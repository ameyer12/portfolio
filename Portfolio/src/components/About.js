            <p className="about-me-paragraph">I’m 23 years old, and I live in Fort Worth, Texas. I graduated with an English degree from The University of Texas at Austin in 2021. During college, my goal was to become a lawyer, but it wasn’t until graduating and preparing to apply for law school that I realized that wasn’t the path I wanted to take. 
            I majored in English because I am passionate about researching and writing about complex topics, but I was never sure how I would turn that passion into a career until I started coding.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I started coding in 2022, and I fell in love with how it allows me to express my passion for writing in a tangible way. After self-learning HTML and CSS, I enrolled in a web development bootcamp at Fullstack Academy to build foundational programming skills while learning the latest technologies. 
            I graduated from the bootcamp in December 2022 and am now pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at The University of North Texas. My goal is to become a junior developer to contribute to real-world projects and continue growing as a programmer.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Outside of web development, I enjoy playing soccer, collecting vinyl records, going to the gym, and hanging out with friends and family.
